[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/)

## Problem Domain

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the _length of the **diameter** of the tree_.

The **diameter** of a binary tree is the **length** of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the `root`.

The **length** of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.
